# ðŸŽ¯ TODO

## Future

- [ ] 1 more options (any combination of options should work)
  - [ ] `conventional (boolean) [true]` - only allow conventional commits, this package should work without conventional commits as well
- [ ] small docs site with astro starlight explaining which emoji to use and when, + stuff
- [ ] BUN

### v2.0.4

- [ ] new option `nested-behavior (string) [all]` - tells the package where to look for nested emojis
  - [ ] `scope` - only in the scope: immediately after the type, like: `feat(scope): subject`, for stricter control over nested emojis
  - [ ] `subject` - only in the subject: `feat(scope): subject`
  - [ ] `all` - anywhere in the commit message (default)
  - [ ] `off` - do not respect nested emojis at all
- improve debug level 2 config output
- allow emojis to be disabled by passing undefined (nested as well)

## v2

- [x] Add e2e tests with github actions (for all operating systems)
- [x] Upgrade to unbuild `2.0.0` (currently errors), fix `masquerading as CJS` error [(see here)](https://arethetypeswrong.github.io/?p=eemoji) (fixed it but we ESM only now because i dont know what to do with the bin/eemoji.mjs entry file)
- [x] Upgrade antfu/eslint-config to `2.0.0` and make it work
- [x] `strict (boolean) [false]` - do not allow any commits without emojis
- [x] add `-v` alias for `--version`
- [x] make the consola start and success logs sane in the cleanup command
- [x] investigate speed, prepare script for init
- [x] move bin scripts to `scripts` folder and also build them from typescript
- [x] Generate the readme emoji table from `default.jsonc` (jsonc for description)
- [x] overwrite the default emojis in ts config too (import the default emojis, import other presets)
